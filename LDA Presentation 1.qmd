## Methods

### Dataset

-   Longitudinal data of 3823 hemodialysis patients over six months:
    -   Monthly Hgb concentrations
    -   Monthly Erythropoietin (EPO): EPO for the next month was decided by the Hgb level of the current month
    -   Iron deficiency status at each month
    -   Background data: age and sex
-   Unbalanced data: not all patients were follow the whole six months

::: notes
Longitudinal data on Monthly Hgb measurements and EPO doses over 6 months in hemodialysis patients. But the data is unbalanced.
:::

## Methods

### Exploratory Data Analyses

-   Individual-specific profiles
-   Graphical methods to explore mean structure, variance structure and correlation structure
-   Test linear and quadratic relationship of each patient' Hgb levels and time: $R^2_{meta}$

::: fragment
### Summary statistics

-   Analysis of each time point: comparison about hemoglobin levels between female and male group at each time point
-   Analysis of increment: subject-specific changes of hemoglobin from baseline ($y_{i1}$) to the last observation ($y_{in_{i}}$): $y_{in_{i}}-y_{i1}$
-   Area under the curve: $$AUC_{i}=(t_{i2}-t_{i1})X(y_{i1}+y_{i2})/2+(t_{i3}-t_{i2})X(y_{i2}+y_{i3})/2+...$$

## Methods

### Multivariate model

-   Initial model, with unstructured covariance: \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    Y_{ij} &= \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \, \text{age}_{i} + \beta_{2} \, \text{sex}_{i} + \beta_{3} \, \text{iron}_{ij} + \beta_{4} \, \text{dose}_{ij} + \beta_{5} \, \text{month}_{j} + \beta_{6} \, \text{month}_{j}^{2} \\
         &\quad + \beta_{7} (\text{dose}_{ij} \times \text{age}_{i}) + \beta_{8} (\text{dose}_{ij} \times \text{sex}_{i}) + \beta_{9} (\text{dose}_{ij} \times \text{iron}_{ij}) + \beta_{10} (\text{dose}_{ij} \times \text{month}_{j}) \\
         &\quad + \beta_{11} (\text{month}_{j} \times \text{age}_{i}) + \beta_{12} (\text{month}_{j} \times \text{sex}_{i}) + \beta_{13} (\text{month}_{j} \times \text{iron}_{ij}) + \epsilon_{ij}
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

::: fragment
-   Reduce mean structure: F-test

## Methods

### Two-stage analysis model {.smaller .scrollable}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
::: fragment
#### Stage 1: Linear regression model for each subject separately

Linear effect of time Hgb levels: 

$$Y_{ij} = \beta_{1i} + \beta_{2i} t_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}, \quad j = 0, \dots, 5$$

:::
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: fragment
#### Stage 2: Explain variability in the subject-specific regression coefficients using known covariates

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \beta_{1i} &= \beta_0^{(1)} + \beta_{\text{Age}}^{(1)} \cdot \text{Age}_i + b_{1i} \\
    \beta_{2i} &= \beta_0^{(2)} + \beta_{\text{Age}}^{(2)} \cdot \text{Age}_i + b_{2i}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
```
-   $b_{1i}$, $b_{2i}$ are independent and $\sim N(0,D)$
:::
:::
:::

::: notes
First we model the linear relationship of each subject's hemoglobin with time. Then we modeled the between-subject variability by examining the effect of age on the intercepts and slopes
:::

## Methods

### Linear mixed model

Four-stage model building process:

#### Step 1: elaborated LMM

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1Age_i + \beta_2Sex_i + \beta_3Dose_{ij} + \beta_4Iron_{ij} + \beta_5t_{ij} + \\
(\beta_6Age_i + \beta_7Sex_i + \beta_7Dose_{ij} + \beta_8Iron_{ij})t_{ij} + (\beta_9Age_i + \beta_{10}Sex_i + \beta_{11}Iron_{ij})Dose_{ij} + \\
  b_{1i} + b_{2j}t_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
```


::: fragment
#### Step 2: Test serial correlation function in residual covariance structure using REML log-likelihood

:::

::: fragment

#### Step 3: Reduce random effect structure using Likelihood ratio test


#### Step 4: Reduce mean structure using F-test

-   Compare model from step 3 with models removing interaction effects one by one, using F-test

## Results

### Summary statistics

::: {.column width="\"50%"}
-   Analysis of increments:

![](Results/Hb%20increment.png)

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Analysis of AUC
    -   $AUC_i$ ranged from -22.5 to 82.4 (mean 42,7, SD 17.8)
    -   Each year increase in age, $AUC_i$ also increased 0.073 (p\<0.001)
    -   No significant effect of sex on AUC
:::
:::

::: notes
Majority of patients tended to have minor change in Hgb levels. Analysis of AIC suggested that Increase in age leads to increase in AUC. Disadvantages: only use partial information so not insightful
:::

## Multivariate model

### Finding parsimonous mean structure

-   Reduce each term and perform F-test against the full model:

| Reduction                               | DF  | F-value | Pr \> F |
|-----------------------------------------|-----|---------|---------|
| *month*$^2$                             | 1   | 1.14    | 0.28    |
| *dose\*sex, dose\*age* and *dose\*iron* | 3   | 1.63    | 0.18    |
| *month\*age* *and month\*sex*           | 5   | 1.95    | 0.08    |
| *month\*iron*                           | 6   | 2.71    | 0.01    |
| *month\*dose*                           | 6   | 6.73    | \<0.001 |

::: notes
multivariate model is a more sophisticated approach to overcome that drawback.

From the full model, we were able to reduce the mean structure by removing some interaction terms.

### Finding appropriate covariance structure

| Covariance structure       | Prameters | -2 Log Likelihood | $G^2$  | df  | p-value |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Unstructured               | 21        | 27693.1           |        |     |         |
| Simple                     | 1         | 32007.9           | 4314.8 | 20  | \<0.001 |
| Compound symmetry          | 2         | 28358.7           | 665.6  | 19  | \<0.001 |

| First-order autoregressive | 2         | 27755.5           | 62.4   | 19  | \<0.001 |
| Toeplitz                   | 6         | 27735.8           | 42.7   | 15  | 0.002   |

::: notes
The likelihood ratio tests show that the unstructured covariance structure is still superior to other structures

## Multivariate model

### Final model: unstructured covariance structure

-   Effect estimates:

| Effect                 | Estimate | Standard Error | p-value |
|------------------------|----------|----------------|---------|
| Intercept              | 10.61    | 0.09           | \<0.001 |
| Age                    | 0.003    | 0.001          | 0.03    |
| Male                   | 0.10     | 0.04           | 0.008   |
| Iron deficiency        | 0.17     | 0.03           | \<0.001 |
| EPO dose               | 0.0005   | 0.001          | 0.006   |
| Month                  | -0.04    | 0.01           | 0.01    |
| Dose\*month            | 0.0005   | 0.0001         | \<0.001 |
| Iron deficiency\*month | -0.05    | 0.02           | 0.01    |

::: notes
The estimates from the final models suggest that Hemoglobin increase with age, male gender, and EPO dose. The effect of EPO dose increase over time. People with iron deficiency suprisingly have higher Hemoglobin level, but that effect decreases over time.

Now Luong will continue the presentation.

## Two-stage analysis

### Stage-1 analysis

- Subject-specific linear regression model for patients with at least 2 measurements

| **Variable** | **N** | **Mean** | **Std Dev** | **Minimum** | **Maximum** |
|--------------|-------|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Intercept    | 2933  | 10.92    | 1.36         | 4.45        | 18.77       |
| month        | 2933  | 0.03     | 0.69         | -5.00       | 7.10        |

::: notes
A linear regression model between Hgb and time was fitted for each patient to explain within-subject variability (as Trang mentioned). 
The mean Hgb concentration on the first month is 10.92 g/dl (ranging from 4.45 to 18.77) and the mean slope is 0.03 (ranging from -5 to 7.1)
:::

## Two-stage analysis

### Stage-2 analysis

-   Effect of age on the intercept:

| **Variable** | **Parameter Estimate** | **Standard Error** | **T Value** | **P-value** |
|--------------|------------------------|--------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Intercept    | 10.61                  | 0.108              | 98.53       | <0.0001     |
| AGE          | 0.005                   | 0.002              | 2.97        | 0.003       |

-   Effect of age on the slope:

| **Variable** | **Parameter Estimate** | **Standard Error** | **T Value** | **P-value** |
|--------------|------------------------|--------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Intercept    | 0.157                   | 0.0553              | 2.83        | 0.005      |
| AGE          | -0.002                  | 0.0009              | -2.17       | 0.030       |

::: notes
In this analysis we examined the effect of age on the trend of Hgb levels across months. The goal was to model the between-subject variability (as Trang mentioned).

A unit increase in age is associated with a slight increase (0.005 g/dl) in the baseline Hgb level.

As age increases, the rate of change in Hgb level over time decreases slightly (~ 0.002 g/dl).

All these effects are statistically significant.

## Linear mixed model

### Mean structure was identical to the multivariate model

| **Effect**                   | **Linear Mixed Model Estimate (SE)** | **P-value** | **Multivariate Model Estimate (SE)** | **P-value** |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Intercept**                | 10.62 (0.1)                         | <0.0001     | 10.61 (0.1)                         | <0.0001     |
| **EPO dose**                 | 0.0005 (0.0002)                     | 0.005       | 0.0005 (0.0002)                     | 0.006       |
| **Age**                      | 0.0027 (0.001)                      | 0.04        | 0.0028 (0.001)                      | 0.03        |
| **Male**                     | 0.10 (0.04)                         | 0.01        | 0.10 (0.04)                         | 0.008       |
| **Iron deficiency**          | 0.17 (0.03)                         | <0.0001     | 0.17 (0.03)                         | <0.0001     |
| **Month**                    | -0.028 (0.02)                       | 0.07        | -0.038 (0.02)                       | 0.02        |
| **EPO dose * month**         | 0.0005 (0.0001)                     | <0.0001     | 0.0006 (0.0001)                     | <0.0001     |
| **Iron deficiency * month**  | -0.043 (0.02)                       | 0.02        | -0.047 (0.02)                       | 0.01        |
- EPO dose, age, sex, iron, EPO dose * month, and iron * month were significant

::: notes
- We also performed the F-test for fixed effects and that gave us the same p-values as the wald test shown on the slide.
- Over all, the mean Hgb concentration decreases over time, though it's not significant in LMM, but only in multivariate model.
- EPO increases Hgb over time, counteract the decrease in Hgb over time.
- Iron-deficient patients have higher baseline Hgb but there Hgb decreases over time
- Patients with higher EPO dose have higher baseline Hgb
- Older patients and male patients have higher baseline Hgb

## Linear mixed model

### Variance components

| **Effect**                        | **Parameter** | **Estimate (SE)**   |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Covariance of** $b_i$           |               |                     |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var($b_{1i}$)   | $d_{11}$      | 0.6919 (0.0556)     |
| **Measurement error variance**     |               |                     |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var($\epsilon_{(1)ij}$) | $\sigma^2$ | 0.2923 (0.0164)    |
| **Gaussian serial correlation**    |               |                     |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var($\epsilon_{(2)ij}$) | $\tau^2$ | 1.9210 (0.1312)    |

::: notes
- The varaince of the random intercept was 0.69
- The measurement error variance was 0.29
- The Gaussian serial correlation variance was 1.92 
:::

## Linear mixed model vs two-stage model

- Random slope against random intercept:
![](Results/Subject-specific.png)

::: notes
- Two-stage model demonstrated a slightly downward trend between the random effects
- A strong positive linear relationship observed between the random effects in the LMM
- This marked differences could be attributed to the fact that the two-stage model does not take into account the correlation structure in the data; hence, do not use the full information of the data. 
:::

## Conclusions

- The mean Hgb concentration decreases over time

- Higher EPO dose >>> higher Hgb over time

- Iron-deficient patients >>> higher baseline Hgb, Hgb decreases over time

- Higher EPO dose >>> higher baseline Hgb

- Older patients and male patients >>> higher baseline Hgb

- Linear mixed model vs multivariate model

::: notes
Linear mixed model and multivariate model provided similar results, but the LMM had a broader usecase.
